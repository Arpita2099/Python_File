# + is used to add the number, also is used to add two string together. For instance,
a="Hello "
b="Arpita Sah"
print(a+b)

x=30
y=45
print(x+y)

# We have to note one thing that when you want to add one number and other string uning + it will show the error in  the code. Therefore, add the same either number or string using +.
